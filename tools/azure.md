### ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure ‚Äì Compute & Networking

#### Virtual Machines & Networking
1. **Your Azure VM is unreachable ‚Äî how do you troubleshoot?**
   - Check NSG rules, UDRs, and route tables.
   - Confirm VM status and Boot Diagnostics.
   - Verify subnet association and public IP configuration.
   - Validate DNS resolution and SSH/RDP settings.

2. **How do you design a highly available VM setup in Azure?**
   - Use Availability Sets or Availability Zones.
   - Use Azure Load Balancer or Application Gateway.
   - Configure autoscale with Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS).

3. **VM is running but app is inaccessible ‚Äî what do you check?**
   - Ensure the service is running inside the VM.
   - Check NSG, subnet, and firewall settings.
   - Validate DNS and Application Gateway configuration.

4. **How do you automate scaling of VMs in Azure?**
   - Use VMSS with autoscale rules based on metrics (CPU, custom metrics).
   - Use scheduled scaling profiles.

5. **How do you handle a failed or deallocated VM?**
   - Use VM backup or custom images to recreate.
   - Use VMSS for automatic instance replacement.

6. **How do you automate patching of Azure VMs?**
   - Use Azure Automation Update Management.

8. **Which services require a VNet in Azure?**
   - VMs, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure App Service (with VNet Integration), Azure Functions (Premium), etc.

9. **How do you securely connect VNets across regions?**
   - Use VNet Peering or Azure VPN Gateway with VNet-to-VNet connections.
   - Use Azure Virtual WAN for large-scale setups.

#### IAM & Roles
10. **Can you assign multiple Managed Identities to an Azure VM?**
    - No, only one system-assigned identity; multiple user-assigned identities are supported.

11. **What IAM permissions does a Function App require?**
    - Depends on services it accesses. Assign a managed identity and RBAC roles.

12. **What permissions are required for Azure Monitor logging?**
    - Read permissions on resources + `Log Analytics Contributor` or `Monitoring Reader`.

### üåê Azure ‚Äì Storage & CDN

#### Blob Storage
2. **How do you restrict Blob Storage from public access?**
   - Disable public access at account level.
   - Configure Shared Access Signatures (SAS) or use Private Endpoints.

3. **How do you optimize Blob storage costs?**
   - Use Access Tiers: Hot, Cool, and Archive.

4. **What is a Shared Access Signature (SAS)?**
   - Token that grants limited access to storage resources without exposing keys.

5. **How do you troubleshoot app access issues to Blob Storage?**
   - Verify RBAC roles, SAS permissions, and firewall settings.

6. **How do you serve a static website with HTTPS using Azure Blob Storage?**
   - Enable static website hosting and front it with Azure CDN and HTTPS.
